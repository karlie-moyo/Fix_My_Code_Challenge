I was tasked with identifying and resolving issues such as syntax errors, logical bugs, and performance inefficiencies to make the code function correctly. This challenge tests problem-solving and debugging skills, as well as the ability to optimize and improve existing code.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª |

This repository contains the folder and files created for the _**FIX MY CODE CHALLENGE** Files._
Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all solutions. I'm not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.

This was a project provided by UoS in which I was challenged with debugging various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar with, others of which I was not. The specific list of projects contained as follows:
